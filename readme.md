What’s inside
Years: 1975–2024 (50)

Countries: 80 reporters (exporters) × 50 partners (importers) — disjoint sets

Products: 5 categories (AGRI, ENER, META, CHEM, MACH)

Columns (16): year, reporter_iso3, partner_iso3, product_code, distance_km, fta_active, adval_tariff_pct, reporter_gdp_bln, partner_gdp_bln, reporter_pop_m, partner_pop_m, reporter_cpi, partner_cpi, export_value_usd_mln, quantity_tonnes, unit_price_usd_per_tonne.

How the data behave (all synthetic)
Gravity model: trade value ∝ (𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑟×𝐺𝐷𝑃𝑝)/𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒^1.2 , with a +FTA multiplier and tariff penalty, plus lognormal shocks.

Tariffs drift down over time and drop more when an FTA is active (random 12% of pairs, random start years 1990–2014).

Country-year macros (GDP, population, CPI) evolve with stochastic growth.

Distances use haversine between simulated coordinates by continent.
